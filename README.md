Collection of IDL routines for X-Ray telescopes design and simulation and for surface data analysis.

It is messy because of the bad habit of mixing in same folder libraries and code at any level of development and the entire source base (from times before version control) was uploaded. 

This is no long actively maintained, and in current status it is difficult to find anything.
A possible starting point can be `cmmdatafile__define`, `cmmsurface__definedev`, `cmmprofile__define` in
`pool/surfaces`.

Functions in libraries are quite documented, I don't exclude to clean up the collection and generate some documentation if I will have any reason to touch the code again (I don't even have a version of IDL at the moment).

Most of the work was ported to or continued in python:
