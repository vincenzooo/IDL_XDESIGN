;;energy        energy of xray source [keV]
;;Dmax          the largest diameter of the outermost shell [mm] - [min, max, step] when Dmax is variable
;;variable      contains which parameter is varying
;                currently limited to Dmax, nshell, and offax
;;xaxis		used only make plots - establishes which variable will be on the x-axis
;		 set to energy to plot energy on x-axis
;                set to var to plot selected variable on x-axis
;;halfFOV       half feild of view [arcmin]
;;srcdis        distance between telescope and xray source [km]
;;L1            length of the first section of optic [mm]
;                this program always assumes L1=L2 so L1=1/2 of total length
;;focallen      focal length in mm (from inflection to detector plane)
;;offax         the off-axis angle of your xray source [arcmin] - [min, max, step] when offax is variable
;;num_phtn      number of photons starting at your xray source
;;doscatter     if 1, simulates surface micro-roughness
;;pctL1         percent decrease of shell length as you move inward
;		 used to maximize off-axis response
;                pctL1 not currently being used - the lengths of the shells are constant
;;nshell        number of shells being nested - [min, max, step] when nshell is variable
;;filename	what to name generated files
;;spacing	spacing between shells [mm; if !NULL then tight spacing]
;;file_path     where to write output files
;;reflc_path    where to read refectivity files
